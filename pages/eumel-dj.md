# EUMEL.Dj
A remote DJ application which plays songs on a party and guests can vote on songs to play. The proejct page can be found [here](https://github.com/EUMEL-Suite/EUMEL.Dj).

## Mobile App

The mobile app uses a QR Code to connect to the application and get a token for communication. After login, the user can see the playlist, vote for songs (and remove a vote) and send messages to the server and other users. 

The settings page shows information about the user and the user can control the player, if s/he has admin access.

# Implementation Details

The implementation details can be found in a separate [https://marpit.marp.app/](marp)-based [marpme.md](presentation).

A [marpme.pdf](pdf document) is available but not always up to date.
